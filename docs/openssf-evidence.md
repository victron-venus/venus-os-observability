# OpenSSF Best Practices evidence: venus-os-observability

This index supports review against the [OpenSSF Passing criteria](https://www.bestpractices.dev/en/criteria/0). It is not an awarded badge, a security guarantee or a completed self-attestation. Initial source inventory: `737c0d51a6378a96f32f52afbf109b667444a0e0`. Re-check the final merged commit and its CI before submitting an assessment.

## Project and contribution process

Exports D-Bus/MQTT observations to OpenTelemetry and Prometheus.

- [Public repository and history](https://github.com/victron-venus/venus-os-observability) provide source, commits and interim changes.
- [README](../README.md) describes installation, configuration and usage.
- [Contribution process](../CONTRIBUTING.md) documents reports, review, style and the policy to add automated tests for major changes.
- [Issues](https://github.com/victron-venus/venus-os-observability/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/victron-venus/venus-os-observability/pulls) provide searchable public discussion and change review.
- [Security policy](../SECURITY.md) documents confidential reporting, response goals, trust boundaries and delivery practices.

The root [LICENSE](../LICENSE) records the project license. Third-party components retain their own notices.

## Implementation and interfaces

- [src/venus_observability](../src/venus_observability)
- [config.example.yaml](../config.example.yaml)
- [alert-mqtt-bridge](../alert-mqtt-bridge)

Interface documentation must explain accepted configuration and inputs, outputs, failure handling and relevant permission boundaries. Verify it against the implementation when changing behavior; source links alone do not establish that every interface is documented.

## Build, test and analysis evidence

The local validation entry point is [scripts/ci.sh](../scripts/ci.sh). Its actual test and compiler/linter commands, not the presence of a workflow name, define the available coverage.

[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/victron-venus/venus-os-observability/actions) provides run logs and results. The checked-in workflow definitions are:

- [auto-approve.yml](../.github/workflows/auto-approve.yml)
- [auto-merge.yml](../.github/workflows/auto-merge.yml)
- [ci.yml](../.github/workflows/ci.yml)
- [codeql.yml](../.github/workflows/codeql.yml)
- [coderabbit-autofix.yml](../.github/workflows/coderabbit-autofix.yml)
- [coderabbit-review.yml](../.github/workflows/coderabbit-review.yml)
- [dependency-review.yml](../.github/workflows/dependency-review.yml)
- [docker.yml](../.github/workflows/docker.yml)
- [lint.yml](../.github/workflows/lint.yml)
- [quality-gate.yml](../.github/workflows/quality-gate.yml)
- [release-build.yml](../.github/workflows/release-build.yml)
- [release-pipeline.yml](../.github/workflows/release-pipeline.yml)
- [release-security.yml](../.github/workflows/release-security.yml)
- [scorecards.yml](../.github/workflows/scorecards.yml)
- [test.yml](../.github/workflows/test.yml)

Do not equate a green metadata or release job with successful application tests. Record actual test results, coverage limitations and security-analysis results for the submitted revision. Test execution does not establish physical-device behavior.

## Items requiring explicit verification before submission

- Confirm the private reporting channel works and examine issue/advisory history. Historical response-time claims require actual reports and responses, including any reports outside GitHub.
- Obtain primary-developer attestations about secure-design and vulnerability-prevention knowledge; repository text cannot establish a person's knowledge.
- Verify every user-facing release has useful release notes and upgrade impact, and includes any assigned vulnerability identifiers for fixes.
- Review dependency, code-scanning and secret-scanning findings and their age. A workflow success result is not proof that all findings are resolved.
- Review the actual cryptographic libraries, protocols, key lengths, randomness, certificate checks and password storage applicable to this project. Do not copy another project's answers.
- Verify build reproducibility from source, test policy adherence in recent substantive changes, dynamic analysis and any manual-memory-code checks.
- Link only this project's real awarded badge once the assessment is accepted.

The live assessment, when created, is the source of truth for the badge level. Unverified criteria remain open.

## Release-note source

[CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md) contains the current development line's change summary, upgrade impact and security notes. The release policy opts into commit-pinned notes; publication rejects missing or incomplete current-version sections. Historical release bodies still require a separate audit before claiming complete coverage.

The October 2026 maintenance imports the release identity and metadata parser
from `venus-os-ci-toolkit` revision `9dd211a`, including bounded TOML parsing and
source-bound release-note validation. Consumer release-contract suites verify
the imported engine. Workflow-validator refactoring preserves this repository's
existing policy; it does not imply all newer toolkit workflow guarantees are enabled.
