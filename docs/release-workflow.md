# CI and release operations — victron-venus/venus-os-observability

The source of truth is `.release-policy.json`. `quality-gate.yml` runs the callable
validation workflows and produces the required **CI gate** status on every PR
and merge-queue commit. Missing, failed and skipped validation workflows fail
the gate. Workflow and lockfile changes are included in validation.

## Local checks

Use Python 3.11+ for the CLI and the project toolchains documented in `scripts/ci.sh`.
The scripts fail on missing dependencies and do not publish anything during checks.

```bash
python3 scripts/release.py check
python3 scripts/release.py status
```

Callable validation workflows:
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- `.github/workflows/lint.yml`
- `.github/workflows/test.yml`
- `.github/workflows/docker.yml`
- `.github/workflows/release-security.yml`
- `.github/workflows/codeql.yml`

The [release strategy](../RELEASING.md) defines versioning, channels, acceptance,
ownership, hotfixes and rollback. This document is the operational runbook.

## Nightly, beta and RC

During rollout, checks and builds run but public candidate publication is disabled
until repository variable `RELEASE_CHANNELS_ENABLED=true`. Enable it only after
required release reviewers are configured and legacy production webhooks have
been migrated. This prevents the first nightly/beta from reaching an old auto-deploy
handler. Manual beta/RC/stable requests fail with an explicit configuration error
until enabled; build-only nightlies remain available in Actions artifacts.

Nightly runs daily at the repository's staggered UTC schedule. Default-branch
pushes request beta builds through the same validation and build gates. Publication
also requires the opt-in variable and an eligible unreleased base version. GitHub can delay
scheduled runs; schedule timing is not an SLA. A committed base version (`X.Y.Z`)
is required. Version changes go through PR review, including any native companion
version files. Native binaries keep that base version; the release manifest records
the beta/RC/nightly channel and exact source SHA.

From a clean checkout matching GitHub's default-branch HEAD:

```bash
python3 scripts/release.py package --version 1.2.3 --channel rc
python3 scripts/release.py nightly --dry-run
python3 scripts/release.py beta --version 1.2.3
python3 scripts/release.py rc --version 1.2.3
python3 scripts/release.py status
```

Replace the example version with the committed project version. Native multi-OS
packages require the hosted build matrix; local packaging covers only supported
local targets. These commands never stage unrelated changes, push `main`, or create
tags directly. Publication commands dispatch `release-pipeline.yml` on the default
branch; `package` builds locally, `status` reads run history, and `--dry-run` only
displays the request.

If the base version already has a stable release, bump the committed version through
a PR before beta/RC publication. Nightly builds may still use that existing base.

Candidate tags are unique and immutable: `vX.Y.Z-beta.N`, `vX.Y.Z-rc.N`, or
`vX.Y.Z-nightly.<UTC timestamp>.<run>.<attempt>`. Candidates are prereleases and
never update stable/latest. All required platforms must build before publication.
`release-manifest.json` records source SHA, workflow/run attempt and every payload
SHA-256. The manifest is also saved in immutable Actions evidence for 90 days.

## Stable promotion

After testing the RC on the intended target/environment:

```bash
python3 scripts/release.py doctor
python3 scripts/release.py stable --rc v1.2.3-rc.1 --dry-run
python3 scripts/release.py stable --rc v1.2.3-rc.1
```

Approve the pending `release` environment in GitHub Actions. The publisher checks
that reviewers are configured, verifies the RC's successful run/attempt, default
branch ancestry, Release gate, immutable evidence and every payload checksum.
Stable `vX.Y.Z` copies the tested RC bytes without rebuilding. No override or
force-tag option exists. Expired/missing evidence requires a new RC. A partial
upload remains an unpublished draft; inspect it before any manual recovery.

GitHub releases do not deploy production. Existing push/tag/CI deployment hooks
must be migrated or disabled before enabling automatic prereleases. Container
and PyPI publication use verified stable assets as a separate explicit operation.

```bash
# Verify and display the exact registry operations; requires skopeo and registry login.
python3 scripts/publish_verified.py containers --tag v1.2.3
# Import the same OCI bytes, then optionally move latest after all version tags exist.
python3 scripts/publish_verified.py containers --tag v1.2.3 --execute --latest
```

If publication partially fails, inspect the existing immutable version tags before
retrying. The tool refuses to overwrite them. Never rebuild an image for stable.

```bash
# Requires twine and publication credentials; wheel bytes come from the checked RC.
python3 scripts/publish_verified.py pypi --tag v1.2.3
python3 scripts/publish_verified.py pypi --tag v1.2.3 --execute
```

## Project limits and rollout requirements

- Hardware-free checks do not validate a live Venus OS device, D-Bus firmware ABI, physical sensors or in-place device upgrades.
- Candidate packaging preserves committed runtime version metadata. Nightly/beta/RC identity is recorded by the release manifest.
- OCI container assets are verified and promoted with the GitHub release. Registry and PyPI deployment must use a separately reviewed promotion adapter; CI does not update latest.
- Legacy IPK publishing is retired; the supported Venus OS deliverable is the complete SetupHelper runtime archive.

For public repositories, merge and verify the workflows before enabling the
additive Terraform **CI gate** ruleset. Where release/deployment workflows use
environments, configure reviewers and default-branch-only policies. The governance
repositories contain `release-standards.tf` and opt-in examples for public
repositories only. Do not extend these requirements to private repositories by
buying a plan or to workflows that have not landed.

Existing review/security rules remain in force. Physical hardware, real
credentials/streams and production access are not implied by unit tests or builds.

The release engine/client are vendored from `victron-venus/venus-os-ci-toolkit`.
They are excluded from consumer-specific formatting/type policy. Application
release workflows run the mandatory Release tooling contracts job; validation-only
projects receive the local client, whose contracts run in the toolkit. Update the toolkit source and rerun
`scripts/install_release.py`; `--check` detects drift.
